Keystroke logging, often called Keylogger is a software that tracks or logs the keys struck on your keyboard 💻, typically in a covert manner so that you don't know that your actions are being monitored 👩‍💻.

### Additional
- **GetAsyncKeyState()** : used to determine whether a key is up or down 🔼🔽 at the time the function is called, and whether the key was pressed after a previous call to GetAsyncKeyState. In simpler terms, this is used to check whether a button is pressed or not on the input devices. 


- **Save()** : used to save the pressed keys in the file *log.txt*.


- **Virtual Key Codes** : to check the equivalent virtual key codes of symbolic constant names, hexadecimal values, and mouse or keyboard, [check this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes "Microsoft VirtualKey Codes").


- **ASCII Character Table** : Check out the [ASCII Code Table](http://www.asciitable.com/ "ASCII Table") here.


- **FreeConsole ()** : A process can use the *FreeConsole* function to detach itself from its console 🕶. If other processes share the console, the console is not destroyed, but the process that called *FreeConsole* cannot refer to it. A console is closed when the last process attached to it terminates or calls *FreeConsole*. 


- **Sleep ()** : used to suspends the execution of the program for a specified period of time. This time period is specified as an argument to the *Sleep ()* function.

### How to protect yourself from a Keylogger?

1.  One of the best practices you can use against keyloggers is the **on-screen keyboard** 💻to enter *sensitive information* such as passwords and bank account information. Remember — keyloggers only record keyboard keystrokes. You can avoid this by using your mouse to enter sensitive information. If you have a keylogger on your machine, it will capture the mouse clicks but will be unable to record what you have clicked on 👆. This is a slower process than using your keyboard, but if you use it only for your most sensitive data, it can keep your information private.


2.  **Update your antivirus software regularly** and look for one that specifically targets keyloggers. Antivirus programs have targeted keyloggers through new detection practices to *discover and remove keyloggers* 👀 and other types of malware and spyware from your computer. Most often, you can find a good antivirus program with built in keylogger detection for less than $50 per year.


3.  Check your **firewall settings**. Because keyloggers transmit the information they collect through the internet, a properly *configured firewall* 🔒 can detect keyloggers by monitoring your computer’s activity. Upon detection, the firewall will display a notification or warning of unusual activity being sent from your computer. Some firewalls will provide the option of denying all outbound data.


4.	Another workaround is to install a secure **password manager**. Password managers will securely *store your passwords* 🔑 and automatically log you in when you enter your various accounts. Your passwords will be vulnerable the first time you enter them, but you can use the onscreen keyboard mentioned above. If you’re not sure at any point, you can change passwords frequently in your password manager.
