### Additional
- **GetAsyncKeyState()** : used to determine whether a key is up or down 🔼🔽 at the time the function is called, and whether the key was pressed after a previous call to GetAsyncKeyState. In simpler terms, this is used to check whether a button is pressed or not on the input devices. 


- **Save()** : used to save the pressed keys in the file *log.txt*.


- **Virtual Key Codes** : to check the equivalent virtual key codes of symbolic constant names, hexadecimal values, and mouse or keyboard, [check this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes "Microsoft VirtualKey Codes").


- **ASCII Character Table** : Check out the [ASCII Code Table](http://www.asciitable.com/ "ASCII Table") here.


- **FreeConsole ()** : A process can use the *FreeConsole* function to detach itself from its console 🕶. If other processes share the console, the console is not destroyed, but the process that called *FreeConsole* cannot refer to it. A console is closed when the last process attached to it terminates or calls *FreeConsole*. 


- **Sleep ()** : used to suspends the execution of the program for a specified period of time. This time period is specified as an argument to the *Sleep ()* function.
